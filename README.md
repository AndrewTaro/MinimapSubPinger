# Submarine Pingers on Minimap
This modification indicates the submarine pingers on your minimap with the red circle.

It is recommended to install the [Advanced Attention Marker](https://github.com/AndrewTaro/AdvancedAttentionMarker) so the pinger icons appear in the 3D world as well.

# Install
1. Download a zip.
2. Unzip the archive and you should get `gui`, `PnFMods` folders, and `PnFModsLoader.py`.
3. Move them to `(wows)/bin/(latest_number)/res_mods/`. So the path will look like `res_mods/PnFModsLoader.py`, etc.
4. Done!
